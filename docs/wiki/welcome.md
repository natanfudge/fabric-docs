# Welcome to your new DokuWiki

Congratulations, your wiki is now up and running. Here are a few more
tips to get you started.

Enjoy your work with DokuWiki,  
\-- the developers

## Create your first pages

Your wiki needs to have a start page. As long as it doesn't exist, this
link will be red: [start](../start.md).

Go on, follow that link and create the page. If you need help with using
the syntax you can always refer to the [syntax page](../wiki/syntax.md).

You might also want to use a sidebar. To create it, just edit the
[sidebar](../sidebar.md) page. Everything in that page will be shown in a
margin column on the side. Read our [FAQ on
sidebars](https://www.dokuwiki.org/faq:sidebar) to learn more.

Please be aware that not all templates support sidebars.

## Customize your Wiki

Once you're comfortable with creating and editing pages you might want
to have a look at the [configuration
settings](https://www.google.com/search?q=doku.php?do=admin&page=config&btnI=lucky)
(be sure to login as superuser first).

You may also want to see what
[plugins](https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugins) and
[templates](https://www.dokuwiki.org/templates) are available at
DokuWiki.org to extend the functionality and looks of your DokuWiki
installation.

## Join the Community
