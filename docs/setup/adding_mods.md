# Adding Mods

For a list of Fabric mods, you can go to Minecraft CurseForge and set the filter type to Fabric.

## Client

To add a mod to your Fabric client, navigate to the mods folder inside your Minecraft directory. If it does not exist, create it now. Download the JAR of the mod you want, and drop it into this folder. Most mods will require Fabric API; you can place the JAR for the API in /mods as well.

## Server

To add a mod to your Fabric server, navigate to the mods folder inside your server installation. If it does not exist, create it now. Download the JAR of the mod you want, and drop it into this folder. Most mods will require Fabric API; you can place the JAR for the API in /mods as well.
