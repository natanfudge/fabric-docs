# Using Technic for Fabric modpacks

1. Open the [Fabric download page](https://fabricmc.net/use/).
2. Use the button to download `version.json` and put it in a `bin`

   directory in your modpack ZIP.  

   **NOTE** The `version.json` will be the _only_ file in bin/. If

   other guides tell you to add additional files to bin/, you're

   probably safe to just ignore that part and keep going.

3. That's it! Do the rest the Technic way.

**PSA** Technic's support of 1.13+ profiles is a bit wonky, and we do a workaround to make it work. As such, no guarantees on our side can or will be made about its functioning.
